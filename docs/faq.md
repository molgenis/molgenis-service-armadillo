# Frequently asked questions

## Docker gives a 'java.socket' error
You might need to enable Docker socket. On Docker desktop you can find that under 'settings' and 'advanced'.

## Can I use docker compose to start profiles?
Instead of making Armadillo start/stop DataSHIELD profiles you can also use docker compose.
See commented section in docker-compose.yml file.

## Can I pass environment or commandline variables instead of application.yml?
Yes, it is standard spring. 

## Can I run Armadillo with oauth2 config offline?
Yes, you can run in 'offline' profile
```
./gradlew run -Dspring.profiles.active=offline
```

## How to run Armadillo version 2?

For armadillo 2.x you can follow instructions at
* for testing we use docker compose at https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-service-armadillo/tree/armadillo-service-2.2.3
* for production we are using Ansible at https://galaxy.ansible.com/molgenis/armadillo`

## How to run Armadillo as developer?
We develop Armadillo using IntelliJ.

### To build Armadillo
Run following command in the github root:
```./gradlew build```

To execute in 'dev' run following command in the github root:
```./gradlew run```

### Setting up development tools
This repository uses `pre-commit` to manage commit hooks. An installation guide can be found
[here](https://pre-commit.com/index.html#1-install-pre-commit). To install the hooks, run `pre-commit install` from the root folder of this repository. Now
your code will be automatically formatted whenever you commit.

### How to change data directory
Data is automatically stored in the `data` folder in this repository. You can choose another location
in `application.yml` by changing the `storage.root-dir`
setting.

> **_Note_**: When you run Armadillo locally for the first time, the `lifecycle` project has not been
> added to the system metadata yet. To add it automatically, see [Application properties](#application-properties).
> Alternatively you can add it manually:
> - Go to the Swagger UI (`http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`)
> - Go to the `PUT /access/projects` endpoint
> - Add the project `lifecycle`
>
> Now you're all set!

### Working with resources in development mode
When developing locally, docker has trouble connecting to localhost. This problem becomes clear when working with
resources. Luckily there is a quick fix for the problem. Instead of defining a resource as for example
`http://localhost:8080/storage/projects/omics/objects/test%2Fgse66351_1.rda`, rewrite it to:
`http://host.docker.internal:8080/storage/projects/omics/objects/test%2Fgse66351_1.rda`. Here's some example R code
for uploading resources:
```R
## Uploading resources
library(MolgenisArmadillo)
library(resourcer)

token <- armadillo.get_token("http://localhost:8080/")

resGSE1 <- resourcer::newResource(
  name = "GSE66351_1",
  secret = token,
  url = "http://host.docker.internal:8080/storage/projects/omics/objects/test%2Fgse66351_1.rda",
  format = "ExpressionSet"
)

armadillo.login("http://localhost:8080/")
armadillo.upload_resource(project="omics", folder="ewas", resource = resGSE1, name = "GSE66351_1")
```
And for using them:
```R
library(DSMolgenisArmadillo)
library(dsBaseClient)

token <- armadillo.get_token("http://localhost:8080/")

builder <- DSI::newDSLoginBuilder()
builder$append(
  server = "local",
  url = "http://localhost:8080/",
  token = token,
  driver = "ArmadilloDriver",
  profile = "uniform",
  resource = "omics/ewas/GSE66351_1"
)

login_data <- builder$build()
conns <- DSI::datashield.login(logins = login_data, assign = TRUE)

datashield.resources(conns = conns)
datashield.assign.resource(conns, resource="omics/ewas/GSE66351_1", symbol="eSet_0y_EUR")
ds.class('eSet_0y_EUR', datasources = conns)
datashield.assign.expr(conns, symbol = "methy_0y_EUR",expr = quote(as.resource.object(eSet_0y_EUR)))
```
