# Armadillo UI

Relevant for: :material-file-table:{title="Data Managers"}

Armadillo features a user interface, or UI for short.

## Login

![Login screen of Armadillo](../../img/ui/login.png)

To login to the UI, select the **Institute account (oath2)** button and login using the institute or organisation login screen you will be redirected to.

### Superuser

You need to have admin or superuser permissions if you want to add projects, users or profiles. This means you need to be granted permission in order to be able to use the UI. If you don't have correct permissions, you will receive the
following error:

![Error message in case you are not a superuser](../../img/ui/no-superuser.png)

If you receive this error, contact someone in your institute that is already able to login without an error, or [contact MOLGENIS Support](../contact.md).

To grant a user superuser permissions simply search for that user in the `Users` tab of the UI, and tick the _admin_ checkbox for that user:

![Grant user superuser rights](../../img/ui/admin.png)

## Projects

Once you're logged in, you will be redirected to the `Projects` page. On this page you can add and edit projects.

You can add users to projects and navigate to the "project-editor"-view and search through the projects using the search bar on the top right.

![Armadillo projects page](../../img/ui/projects.png)

### Editing projects

To edit your project, click on the edit button in front of the project you want to edit: ![Armadillo edit project](../../img/ui/edit.png){width="15"}.

The row will be opened in edit mode:

![Edit a specific row on the projects page](../../img/ui/edit-project.png)

The edit mode can be recognized by its blue background color and you have the option to add new users to your project by clicking on the + button ![Armadillo plus user](../../img/ui/plus.png){width="15"} of the users column. Then, you can either select an existing user from the dropdown, or add the email address of a new user.

![Add an existing user to a project or enter the email address of the new user](../../img/ui/edit-projects-add-user.png)

In case of adding a user in this screen, a warning will be shown to prevent email addresses with typographical errors from being added to your system. For example, if you have the address `j.doe@example.com` in your users table but attempt to add `j.die@example.com` a warning message will be displayed asking if you want to add a new user.

![Warning message to remind you to save the project in order to finalize adding a new user](../../img/ui/add-user-warning.png)

It is not possible to edit the name of your project; this is intentional in order to ensure tables, resources, users, and permissions are transferred to the new project name correctly.

Click on the checkmark ![Armadillo project check](../../img/ui/check.png){width="25"} to save the edited row and the X ![Armadillo project cancel](../../img/ui/cancel.png){width="25"} to cancel.

Be careful, if you do cancel your changes will be lost.

### Adding projects

To add a new project, click on the + button ![Armadillo project add](../../img/ui/add.png){width="25"} on top of the table. If you click this button, an empty row will be opened in edit mode.

![Add a new project to Armadillo](../../img/ui/add-project.png)

Click on the checkmark ![Armadillo project check](../../img/ui/check.png){width="25"} to save the edited row and the X ![Armadillo project cancel](../../img/ui/cancel.png){width="25"} to cancel.

Be careful, if you do cancel your changes will be lost.

## Project explorer

If you click on the icon ![Armadillo project view](../../img/ui/view-project.png){width="40"} next to the project name, you will be directed to the `project editor`. In this screen you can upload and preview data in projects. To go back to your `projects` page,
press the back button ![Armadillo project back](../../img/ui/back-button.png){width="25"}.

![Armadillo project editor](../../img/ui/project-editor.png)

If you click on a folder, it will open.

![Armadillo project folder](../../img/ui/view-project-folder.png)

Here you can upload files to that folder, or click on the tables (files) to preview their contents.

![Armadillo project file preview](../../img/ui/preview-file.png)

To upload files, either drag a file from your file browser to the file upload area, or click the area and select the
file.

![Armadillo upload a file](../../img/ui/upload-a-file.png)

After selecting the file, click on _upload_ to upload it. This usually only takes a few seconds but will take longer in your uploading a large file.

It is also possible to create new folders. To do so, click the "add folder" button ![Armadillo project add folder](../../img/ui/add-folder-button.png){width="30"} just below the project name. An input dialog will be presented:

![Armadillo add a folder](../../img/ui/add-folder.png)

Fill in the name you want to use and click on the checkmark button ![Armadillo project check](../../img/ui/check.png){width="25"}. Please keep in mind that the folder will only be saved if you put data into it. Select the new folder to select files to upload.

### Resources

All file types can be uploaded into Armadillo, however previews will only be available for `.parquet` files. Other files that can be uploaded are treated as _resources_. Resource filetypes usually are `.rda` files or `.Rdata` files.

To be able to use these resources as a researcher, first an `.rds` file must be generated. How to create these files, is described [here](https://molgenis.github.io/molgenis-r-armadillo/articles/create_resources.html).

The URL of your resources should consist of:

```r
{your url}/storage/projects/{project name}/objects/{name of the folder}%2F{the resource file}
```

Here is an example, with some example parameters:

```r
url = "https://armadillo3.demo.molgenis.net"
project = "omics"
folder = "ewas"
file = "gse66351_1.rda"
```

Which results in the following url:

```r
https://armadillo3.demo.molgenis.net/storage/projects/omics/objects/ewas%2Fgse66351_1.rda
```

## Users

The `Users` page works just as the `Projects` page. You can search users by entering (a part of) the email address or name of the user into the search box:

![Search for a user in the Users page](../../img/ui/admin.png)

### Editing users

Users can be edited, **except** for their email addresses. This is because when user's email address changes, that user is possibly no longer working for the same institution and therefore might not be allowed to access the data anymore.

![Editing a user on the Users page](../../img/ui/edit-user.png)

In edit mode, the row will turn blue. Projects can be added by clicking on the + icon ![Armadillo user plus](../../img/ui/plus.png){width="15"}in the projects column.

![Armadillo add user to project](../../img/ui/add-project-to-user.png){width="350"}

You can add a new project by typing it and clicking the checkmark button ![Armadillo project check](../../img/ui/check.png){width="25"}. You will be prompted with a warning message, asking you to confirm if you want to add a new project.

Alternatively, you can select an existing project by using the search box or scrolling through the presented list.

### Adding users

By clicking on the plus button ![Armadillo user add](../../img/ui/add.png){width="25"} on the top of the table, a new user can be added. The row with the new user will turn blue in edit mode.

![Armadillo user add](../../img/ui/add-user.png){width="650"}

Users can be added before they have logged in previously. These users can be added to projects, which will grant them permission to use the data from those projects upon their first login. Researchers should not be set as admin.

## Analysis Profiles

![Armadillo Profiles page](../../img/ui/profiles.png)

Since the release of Armadillo 3.0.0, it is possible to create and manage analysis profiles in the user interface, rather than asking system administrators to manage these profiles. You can start ![Armadillo profile start](../../img/ui/start-profile.png){width="35"} and stop ![Armadillo profile start](../../img/ui/stop-profile.png){width="35"} profiles.

When you start a profile for the first time, it will take a bit longer to load because the profile needs to be downloaded and installed before it can be started.

![Stopping a profile](../../img/ui/loading-stop-profile.png)

If you switch to another screen whilst either starting or stopping a profile, the profiles page will no longer show the loading information. It is however still loading, and when it's done, if you reload the page, you will see that your profile started or stopped successfully.

As in the other screens, you can add profiles with the add-button ![Armadillo profile add](../../img/ui/add.png){width="25"}.

![Add a profile](../../img/ui/add-profile.png)

By default, some fields will be set. Please update them to install the correct profile.

Possible images can be found on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=datashield%2Farmadillo-rserver). We recommend selecting one of the
[DataSHIELD standard profiles](https://wiki.datashield.org/en/opmanag/standard-profiles-and-platforms). The image name of those profiles can be found on the dockerhub link above.

Although the default `port` setting should find an available port, please keep in mind that the port has to be unique, otherwise you cannot start your profile and will receive an error message.

R packages can be whitelisted by adding them to the `package whitelist` column so researchers can use them. 'Whitelisting' a package allows analysts to use it. If you want to whitelist a package, you need to make sure it is installed on the image you selected. Additionally, it is possible to blacklist certain R functions in the `blacklist function` column. This can be useful if certain functions are not allowed to be used on certain data or within certain cohorts.
