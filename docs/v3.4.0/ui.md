# Armadillo User Interface

Since Armadillo version 3, a lot has changed compared to its previous version. One of these changes is the addition of
a user interface, or UI for short. This UI will be replacing the MinIO file storage and the permission management page,
as well as adding several new features that will be extended upon.

## Table of contents

1. [Login](#login)
   1. [Superuser](#superuser)
2. [Projects](#projects)
   1. [Editing projects](#edit-projects)
   2. [Adding projects](#add-projects)
3. [Project explorer](#project-explorer)
   1. [Resources](#resources)
4. [Users](#users)
   1. [Editing users](#edit-users)
   2. [Adding users](#add-users)
5. [Profiles](#profiles)

## Login <a name="login"></a>

![Login screen of Armadillo 3](img/ui/login.png)

To login to the UI, select the **Institute account (oath2)** button and login using the institute or organisation login
screen you will be redirected to.

### Superuser <a name="superuser"></a>

You need to have admin or superuser permissions if you want to add projects, users or profiles. This means you need to
be granted permission in order to be able to use the UI. If you don't have correct permissions, you will receive the
following error:

![Error message in case you are not a superuser](img/ui/no-superuser.png)

If you receive this error, contact someone in your institute that is already able to login without an error, or if you
don't have anyone available, send an email to MOLGENIS Support (molgenis-support@umcg.nl).

To grant a user superuser permissions simply search for that user in the `Users` tab of the UI, and tick off the
_admin_ checkbox for that user:

![Grant user superuser rights](img/ui/admin.png)

## Projects <a name="projects"></a>

Once you're logged in, you will be redirected to the `Projects` page. On this page you can add and edit projects. 

You can add users to projects and navigate to the "project-editor"-view and search through the projects using
the search bar on the top right.

![Armadillo 3 projects page](img/ui/projects.png)

### Editing projects <a name="edit-projects"></a>

To edit your project, click on the edit button in front of the project you want to edit: 
<img src="img/ui/edit.png"  width="25" height="25">.

The row will be opened in edit mode:

![Edit a specific row on the projects page](img/ui/edit-project.png)

The edit mode can be recognized by it's blue background color and you have the option to add new users to your project
by clicking on the + button <img src="img/ui/plus.png"  width="15" height="15"> of the users column. Then, you can either
select an existing user from the dropdown, or add the email address of a new user.

![Add an existing user to a project or enter the email address of the new user](img/ui/edit-projects-add-user.png)

In case of adding a user in this screen, a warning will be shown to prevent email addresses with typographical errors from being added to
your system. To illustrate this, imagine you have the user `j.doe@example.com` in your users table. You want to give
them permissions for a certain project, but you mistakingly type the email address as `j.die@example.com`. A warning message will pop up
asking you whether you really want to add a new user. You will probably think "that's weird, j.doe
already exists, right?", hopefully this will help noticing the incorrect email address. You will probably cancel 
adding the user and instead select the existing user, as you intended to. Keep in mind that, just as the warning message
suggests, the user will only be added if you save the row you are editing in the projects.

![Warning message to remind you to save the project in order to finalize adding a new user](img/ui/add-user-warning.png)

It is not possible to edit the name of your project; this was done intentionally in order to ensure tables, resources,
users, and permissions are transferred to the new project name correctly.

Click on the checkmark <img src="img/ui/check.png"  width="25" height="25"> to save the edited row and the X 
<img src="img/ui/cancel.png"  width="25" height="25"> to cancel. Be careful, if you do cancel your changes will be lost.

### Adding projects <a name="add-projects"></a>

To add a new project, click on the + button <img src="img/ui/add.png"  width="25" height="25"> on top of the table. If
you click this button, an empty row will be opened in edit mode.

![Add a new project to Armadillo](img/ui/add-project.png)

Click on the checkmark <img src="img/ui/check.png"  width="25" height="25"> to save the edited row and the X 
<img src="img/ui/cancel.png"  width="25" height="25"> to cancel. Be careful, if you do cancel your changes will be lost.

## Project explorer <a name="project-explorer"></a>

If you click on the icon <img src="img/ui/view-project.png"  width="40" > next to the project name, you will be directed to
the `project editor`. In this screen you can upload and preview data in projects. To go back to your `projects` page,
press the back button <img src="img/ui/back-button.png"  width="25" height="25">.

![Armadillo project editor](img/ui/project-editor.png)

If you click on a folder, it will open.

![Armadillo project folder](img/ui/view-project-folder.png)

Here you can upload files to that folder, or click on the tables (files) to preview their contents.

![Armadillo project file preview](img/ui/preview-file.png)

To upload files, either drag a file from your file browser to the file upload area, or click the area and select the
file.

![Armadillo upload a file](img/ui/upload-a-file.png)

After selecting the file, click on _upload_ to upload it. Depending on the size of the file it can take a second,
generally it is a fast process.

It is also possible to create new folders. To do so, click the "add folder" button 
<img src="img/ui/add-folder-button.png"  width="30" height="30"> just below the project name. An input dialog will be
presented:

![Armadillo add a folder](img/ui/add-folder.png)

Fill in the name you want to use and click on the checkmark button 
<img src="img/ui/check.png"  width="25" height="25">. Please keep in mind that, just as the success message suggests,
the folder will only be saved if you put data in it. Select the new folder to select files to upload.

### Resources <a name="resources"></a>

In theory, all files can be uploaded into the projects. The only filetypes that allowed for a preview are `.parquet`
files. Other files that can be uploaded are treated as _resources_. Resource filetypes usually are `.rda` files or
`.Rdata` files.

To be able to use these resources as a researcher, first an `.rds` file must be generated. How to create these files, is
described [here](https://molgenis.github.io/molgenis-r-armadillo/articles/create_resources.html).

The URL of your resources is build up as follows:

```r
{your url}/storage/projects/{project name}/objects/{name of the folder}%2F{the resource file}
```

Here's an example, with some example parameters:

```r
url = "https://armadillo3.demo.molgenis.net"
project = "omics"
folder = "ewas"
file = "gse66351_1.rda"
```

Which results in the following url:

```r
https://armadillo3.demo.molgenis.net/storage/projects/omics/objects/ewas%2Fgse66351_1.rda
```

## Users <a name="users"></a>

The `Users` page works just as the `Projects` page. You can search users by entering (part of) their email address or name
of the user into the search box:

![Search for a user in the Users page](img/ui/admin.png)

### Editing users <a name="edit-users"></a>

Users can be edited, **except** for their email addresses. A reason for this is that when a user's email address changes, that user is possibly not
working for the same institution any longer and therefore might not be allowed to access the data anymore.

![Editing a user on the Users page](img/ui/edit-user.png)

In edit mode, the row will turn blue. Projects can be added by clicking on the + icon 
<img src="img/ui/plus.png"  width="15" height="15"> in the projects column.

<img src="img/ui/add-project-to-user.png"  width="350">

You can add a new project by simply typing it and clicking the checkmark button 
<img src="img/ui/check.png"  width="25" height="25">. You will be prompted a warning message, asking you to confirm to
add a new project, once the user is saved.

Alternatively, you can select an existing project by using the search box or scrolling through the presented list, and selecting the desired project.

### Adding users <a name="add-users"></a>

By clicking on the plus button <img src="img/ui/add.png"  width="25" height="25"> on top op the table, a new user can be
added. The row with the new user will turn blue in edit mode.

<img src="img/ui/add-user.png"  width="650">

Users can be added before they have logged in previously. These users can be added to projects, this will grant them
permission to use the data from those projects upon their first login. However, to be able to login to the UI, users have to be admin or superuser. 
Researchers should not be set to be admin. 

## Profiles <a name="profiles"></a>

![Armadillo Profiles page](img/ui/profiles.png)

Since the release of Armadillo 3.0.0, it is possible to create and manage profiles in the user interface, rather than
asking system administrators to manage these profiles. You can start <img src="img/ui/start-profile.png"  width="35">
and stop <img src="img/ui/stop-profile.png"  width="35"> profiles.

When you start a profile for the first time, it will take a bit longer to load because the profile needs to be
downloaded and installed before it can be started.

![Stopping a profile](img/ui/loading-stop-profile.png)

If you switch to the other screens while either starting or stopping a profile, the profiles page will not show the
loading information anymore. It is however still loading, and when it's done, if you reload the page, you will see that
your profile started or stopped successfully.

Just like in the other screens, you can add profiles with the add-button 
<img src="img/ui/add.png"  width="25" height="25">. 

![Add a profile](img/ui/add-profile.png)

By default, some fields will be set. Please update them to install the correct profile. 

Possible images can be found on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=datashield%2Farmadillo-rserver). We
recommend selecting one of the
[DataSHIELD standard profiles](https://www.datashield.org/help/standard-profiles-and-plaforms). The image name of those
profiles can be found on the dockerhub link above.

Although the default `port` setting should find an available port, please keep in mind that the port has to be unique,
otherwise you cannot start your profile and will receive and error message.

R packages can be whitelisted by adding them to the `package whitelist` column so researchers can use them. If you want
to whitelist a package, you need to make sure it is installed on the image you selected. Additionally, it's possible to
blacklist certain R functions in the `blacklist function` column. This can be interesting to use when certain functions
are not allowed to be used on certain data or within certain cohorts.
