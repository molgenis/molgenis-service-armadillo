# Testthat Release Tests - TODO

- [ ] Multiple profiles: support comma-separated CONTAINER env var to repeat tests across profiles (like original release-test.R)
- [ ] Check vs original release: run both test suites side-by-side and verify equivalent results
- [ ] CI: integrate testthat runner into CI pipeline
- [ ] README: document usage, configuration, and test structure
