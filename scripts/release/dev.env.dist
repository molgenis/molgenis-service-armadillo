# Test filtering (used by testthat runner)
# These work the same as --only and --skip command line flags
# Space-separated list of clusters or individual tests
#
# Available clusters:
#   all                  - All tests (default)
#   data-manager         - Data manager and basic auth tests
#   researcher-tables    - Researcher tests for tabular data (no resources)
#   researcher-resources - Researcher tests that use resources (exposome, omics)
#
# Individual tests:
#   data-manager, researcher-login, profiles, assigning-tables, assigning-resources,
#   ds-base, ds-mediate, ds-survival, ds-mtl, ds-exposome, ds-omics, ds-tidyverse,
#   basic-auth
#
# Examples:
#   TEST_ONLY=researcher-resources         # Run only resource tests
#   TEST_ONLY=resources data-manager       # Run resources + data-manager
#   TEST_SKIP=ds-omics ds-exposome         # Skip specific tests
#   TEST_ONLY=resources                    # Can combine with TEST_SKIP
